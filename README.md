# mid-to-notes
The script that allows you to convert mid files into strings with notes.

Initially, this script was made to help aspiring musicians play their instruments according to the melody they would sing or melody that would come to their minds.
If you have any melody, that you sing but want to play using an instrument, you can record it, convert that "mp3" or "wav" file into "mid" format, and then, using that "mid" file find out what notes are there in the melody. Have to notice, that there are lots of harmonics in a human voice, so some of the notes that are shown after convertation can be redundant, still, there won't be a lack of notes that you sang.
